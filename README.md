My name is Nadia. I'm 16 years old and I'm from argentina. My passion for programming, computer science and others came when I was a child, when I watched videos of pc repairs. it sounds weird, I know. 
I'm a python programmer (official) and currently I'm learning more of the language but at the same time I'm getting into SQL.
Apart from programming I listen to music in Russian and English, read, sleep and go to school. I almost don't believe myself when I say that I sleep.

If you want, I can be of much help to you as I am currently looking for a job (obviously, pay me. At least 10 dollars :/)
